# Farmers' Market: A game of buying and selling

## Introduction and rules
_Farmer's Market_ is a simple game of buying and selling.

The premise of the game is simple: You begin with $1000 loan to start your fruit and vegetable stand.

Every day, you are given a new scenario (see below) will cause fruit and vegetable prices to fluctuate. Your goal is to take advantage of swings in the market to earn a profit â€“ buy low, sell high!

Each day you may make one transaction - buy, sell, or _doing nothing_ (also considered a transaction).

But be on the look out, the bank comes knocking every 7 days and collects $25 from your cash on hand.

If you can survive till your loan is paid off, you win!

However, if you default on your debt - ~~it's straight to debtor's prison!~~ you lose! 

## What's happening under the hood


## Background

This project was done as part of my Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly in Washington, DC.

It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and attempts to use SVG graphics as often as possible.

## Technologies used
+ HTML5
+ CSS3
+ Javascript


## Going forward

In the future, it'd be nice to completely refresh the UI, as well as add a "net worth" section with takes into account cash-on-hand and the value of fruit held in the inventory.

I'd also like to make the sun "set" and "rise" with each newDay() function call, as a visual signal to the user that a new day has begun.
