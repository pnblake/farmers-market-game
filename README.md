# Farmers' Market: A game of buying and selling

## Introduction and rules
_Farmer's Market_ is a simple game of buying and selling.

The premise of the game is simple: You begin with $1000 loan to start your fruit and vegetable stand.

Every day, you are given a new scenario (see below) will cause fruit and vegetable prices to fluctuate. Your goal is to take advantage of swings in the market to earn a profit â€“ buy low, sell high!

Each day you may make one transaction - buy, sell, or _doing nothing_ (also considered a transaction).

But be on the look out, the bank comes knocking every 7 days and collects $25 from your cash on hand.

If you can survive till your loan is paid off, you win!

However, if you default on your debt - ~~it's straight to debtor's prison!~~ you lose!
